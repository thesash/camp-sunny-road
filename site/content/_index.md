blurb:
    heading: "Our Story"
    text: "Camp Sunny Road was born in 2016 when a group of friends rallied around the idea of creating their own camp-style festival in Joshua Tree, California.  They played capture the flag, roasted marshmallows and taught each other beat-boxing, twerking, AI and yoga.  

    Camp has grown bigger and badder over the years — and we’ve moved from a Joshua Tree compound to an actual summer camp —but the event is still produced by us, for us.

    Some come to relax, others to let loose in a magical setting. But for all, Camp means four days of uninterrupted play, in an immersive and inspiring environment with best friends new and old.  That’s what we’ve come to know and love about *camp*"
