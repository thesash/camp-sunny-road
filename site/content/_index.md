      text: "Camp Sunny Road was born in November 2016 when a group of friends rallied around the idea of creating their own camp-style festival in Joshua Tree, California. They played capture the flag, roasted marshmallows and taught each other beat-boxing, twerking, AI and yoga.
      <br><br>
      Camp has grown bigger and badder over the years — and we've moved from a modest desert compound to a real accredited summer camp — but the event is still produced by us, for us (and therein lies the magic). Campers build our art installations, DJ our one-of-a-kind dance parties, captain our color war teams and teach our classes.
      <br><br>
      And while there's structure if you want it, you're also free to march to the beat of your own drum. Some come to let loose...some come to play sports...others just come to relax in a setting that's both nostalgic & surreal. But for all, Camp means four days of uninterrupted play, in an immersive and inspiring environment with best friends new and old. That's what we’ve come to know and love about Sunny Road."
